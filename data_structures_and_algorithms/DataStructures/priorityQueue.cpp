/*

A priority queue is a special type of queue in which each element is associated with a priority value .
And elements are served on the basis of their priority, that is higher priority elements are served first 

However, if elements with the same priority occur, they are served according to their order in the queue.

Assigning Priority Value

Generally, the value of the element itself is considered for assigning the priority. For example,

The element with the highest value is considered the highest priority element. However, in other cases, 
we can assume the element with the lowest value as the highest priority element.

We can also set priorities according to our needs.

Difference between Priority Queue and Normal Queue

In a queue, the first-in-first-out rule is implemented whereas, in a priority queue, the values are removed 
on the basis of priority. The element with the highest priority is removed first.
