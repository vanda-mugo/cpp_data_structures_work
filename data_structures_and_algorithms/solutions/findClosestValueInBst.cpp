/*
prompt : write a function that takes in a binary search tree (BST) and a target interger value and returns the closest value to that 
target value contained in the BST
You can assume that there will only be one closest value 

Each BST node has an integer value, a left child node and a right child node. A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the 
BST properly: Its value is stricly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its 
right ; and its children node are either valid BST nodes themselves or none/null.
 

                              tree =            10
                                              /    \
                                            5       15
                                           / \      /  \
                                          2   5    13   22
                                         /           \
                                        1             14
                                        target = 12
                                        sample output = 13
