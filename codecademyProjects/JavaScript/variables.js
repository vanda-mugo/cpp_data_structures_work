// in java script we use var and let keywords to declare variables

var age;
let name;


// difference between var and let 
// var is used with older variables of JS while let is the new way of declaring variables 
// variables created with var are function scoped meaning they can be accessed anywhere within the function
// variables declared with let are block scoped meaning they can only be accessed within the block where they are declared 


let num ;

// assign 5 to variable num 

num = 5;

// you can also declare variables num1 and assign 5 to it 

let num1 = 6;

// declaring multiple variables in a single statement 
let num2 = 7, num3 = 8, num4 = 9;


// changing the variables values

let score = 10;
console.log(score);

score = 2;
console.log(score);
